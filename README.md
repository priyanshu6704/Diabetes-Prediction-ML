Diabetes Prediction System (Machine Learning + Web App)

This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided medical features using a trained **Logistic Regression model**.  
It includes:

Machine Learning model training (Python + Scikit-Learn)
Data visualizations (Matplotlib)
Frontend implementation using model coefficients (JavaScript)
Web-based interface for live prediction
